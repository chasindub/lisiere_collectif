						When they felt the world around them was getting too chaotic, they looked into nature and music to calm their spirits and give life a new meaning. “Lisière Collectif” is the name the trio picked to pay a tribute to what brought <strong>Bogdan Ardeleanu</strong>, <strong>Dan Gheorghe</strong> and <strong>Andu Simion</strong> and  together, the ”Lisière” behind the grey blocks where they spent their childhood.<br><br>
						Inspired by the movement of natural elements blown by the wind, the style they developed in production can be described as minimalist and well-controlled. Although Lisière Collectif was born in the suburbs of Ploieşti, its tunes travel through souls of many techno passionate people around the world.<br><br>
						They established in 2017 the eponymous vinyl label LSR: Lisière Collectif Series, firstly releasing a genius remix created by Priku. For 2018, they have prared a second material containing a remix by Finnish electro duo Morphology, and for the 3rd material SIT (Vlad Caia and Cristi Cons) has joined aboard. Also, more upcoming releases on vinyl as work in progress, along with vibrant selector gigs.
